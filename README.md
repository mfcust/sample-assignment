# Sample Assignment

Hello everyone, and welcome to Computer Science! In this class, we'll learn the basic concepts of programming in Python! Python is a computer programming language that is used for all kinds of things, such as creating Youtube, Spotify, Instagram, and even Google!

This is an example of an assignment that you will receive in this class. The file you're reading right now is known as a markdown file, and you can tell by the .md at the end of the file name. All of the markdown files in this class will be labeled README.md, and they should be read before accessing your python file (file name ends in a .py).

If you're reading this from your Github repo, the first thing you want to do is click the WORK IN REPL.it button to navigate to your repl. Once in your repl, you will be able to read/interact with the markdown file, as well as access your python file. For this assignment, all you need to do is copy the code below, paste it into your python file, and then run it. Here is the code:
```
print('Hello World')
```
If you're looking at this in repl.it, in the tope right of the gray box above, there will be two small rectangles that look like sheets of paper. Clicking this will allow you to copy the code so you can then paste it inside of the python file (.py).

Once you're done with your assignment, you need to commit and push it to our Github classroom. You need to do this for every assignment in this class. To do this, in repl you must navigate to the left side of your screen. There is an icon of a line that branches into two lines, with white circles at the ends. and intersection points. When you hover over this icon, it says __version control__. If you click it, it gives you a textbox to type in a message. When you complete your assignment, type in a message such as "I've finished this assignment" or "I've made corrections" or something like this. Then, you press the commit and push button. I will then get an email notification that you have successfully completed the assignment.

That's it! Navigate to the python file to complete this sample assignment!
